print('hello world')

first_name = 'kyle'

#this was the first lesson: it's called a string concatenation
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
age = 35

#this is the second lesson: string interpolation (inserting variables in strings)

print(f'Hello World! My name is {full_name} and I am {age}'

#old way this worked: print('hello world!  my name is {} and I am {}.format(full_name, age)
